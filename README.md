# Nomads Travel Blog

## 1. Definition Problem

The objective is to design a travel blog application that allows users to create, edit, and delete their own posts. Each user should have exclusive access to their own posts, without being able to view publications made by other users. Additionally, the application should allow all users, regardless of login status, to view and comment posts created by any user.
